# Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level development roadmap for Sentinel Labs. Timelines are approximate and subject to change based on community feedback and resource availability.

## Q2 2025 -- Foundation

**Theme: Ship the core**

| Milestone | Repositories | Status |
|---|---|---|
| sentinel-core v1.0 | sentinel-core | Planned |
| sentinel-agent v1.0 | sentinel-agent | Planned |
| Identity registry API | sentinel-cloud | In progress |
| Attestation verification | sentinel-core | In progress |
| Trust score engine | sentinel-core | In progress |
| Hash-chain audit trail | sentinel-core | In progress |
| Dashboard fleet overview | sentinel-dashboard | In progress |
| TypeScript SDK | sentinel-sdk | Planned |
| Solana attestation program | sentinel-chain | In progress |
| CLI tool (basic ops) | sentinel-cli | Planned |

> Reference implementations of the cloud, dashboard, identity registry, attestation, trust engine, audit trail, and Solana anchoring run today inside the `sentinels` monorepo. The standalone `sentinel-*` repositories are scaffolded and will receive their split-out source as each module hardens. See `STATUS.md` for the verified state.

| Webhook system | sentinel-cloud | Planned |
| Audit export (CSV, JSON, PDF) | sentinel-cloud | Planned |
| Real-time dashboard | sentinel-dashboard | In progress |
| Mobile notifications | sentinel-mobile | Planned |

## Long-term Vision

### 2026-2027

- Cross-organizational trust mesh
- Decentralized identity network (DID / Web5)
- IoT and embedded systems support
- Regulatory compliance frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)
- Edge-native deployment (no cloud dependency)
- Federated trust scoring

### 2027+

- Autonomous trust governance
- Zero-touch fleet operations
- Industry-specific compliance templates
- Global trust network with third-party verification
- Open standard for machine identity
